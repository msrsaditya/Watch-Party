Add all these features to this website without removing/changing any other core/important functionality of the website (implement only these features and DO NOT change anything else in the website). Give full updated code with all of these changes incorporated, and make sure everything is perfect and works exactly as I intended with no bugs/issues whatsoever:

- Add a button in video controls to control the aspect ratio. Clicking on the button should rotate between options such as Original, Pan Scan, 16:9, 16:10, 4:3, and 2:35:1. Long-pressing on this button should display all of these options in a small drop-down menu instead.
- Add brightness (left swipe) and volume (right swipe) gestures.
- Add a button in video controls to lock the whole screen (nothing except that lock button should be visible on the screen, and no gestures or any other controls of any kind or anything MUST not work), and pressing on that button will unlock the screen again (everything comes back to normal, exactly as it was before) 
- Also add another button for Orientation lock, which will lock the video-orientation to portrait or landscape or device (however the device rotates, this should be the default). Pressing this button will rotate between the three options. Long-pressing this button should show all these options in a small drop-down menu instead.
- Also, make sure that the quick comment box is properly visible when typing in it with the keyboard, and ensure the keyboard will never cover it, and it is properly visible.
- Also, in the "Chat" section, always auto-scroll to the last comment so that the user never has to be at the end of the chat; scroll there automatically.
- The highlight of a comment when it arrives, animation and borders are bad looking, the border should only be around the comment box and not the whole thing, also use better colors, animation, styling, and so on... for this to look good and blend in with the rest of the website's design.
- Increase the video controls size so even big hands can touch and interact with them, even on small mobile screens, very easily. This website is built primarily for mobile phones, so proper functioning and easy usage on this platform are of paramount importance.
- The quick comment button, especially, is very, very important. Using it should be buttery smooth, open and close very quickly, and be very friendly to interact with; its UI/UX needs to be heavily optimized for easy, quick, and super-fast interaction. This is the most important part of this website, so take this EXTREMELY seriously and make it a perfect chef's kiss.
- There's a small delay between clicking the send button and it closing afterwards; this should not be there at all. The quick comment box should close instantly after the send button is pressed.
- Also, when a comment appears from a user in full screen, it appears on the screen. This should be animated, so that the comment slowly fades from the bottom to the top of the screen and eventually fades out in the end. Animate this nicely and make that chat appear like a cute bubble.
- Also, increase the entropy for the room code. Since the room code is always copied and never entered manually, improve the room code's entropy so dramatically that it must be virtually impossible for a collision to occur.
- Increase the size of the "Watch Party" title in the lobby a little bit.
- Make the corners of the Join/Host room's card (and their fields and buttons, and everything inside) a little bit rounded. Make sure all buttons, text boxes, and everything else's corners are a little bit rounded like this.
- Make sure the video playback performance is very, very good. It has all the standard performance features like hardware acceleration, hardware decoding, and everything. The video should be played very, very smoothly, and all the best practices to improve video playback performance need to be integrated.
- Add a button to control video playback speed (clicking on it should rotate between 1x and 2x values, and long-pressing should give a slider to set it precisely manually).
- Add a separate audio and comments selection button (again, clicking on it should rotate between existing options, and long-pressing should give all possibilities in a small drop-down menu).
- For comments, also include a button in the drop-down menu (at the top) to add an external file from the system.
- Move the time in video controls to either sides of the progress bar (If it is 12:00/2:00:00 now, move the 12:00 to before the start of the progress bar i.e.; left and 2:00:00 to right (end of progress bar), their controls and functionalities must remain same - for example, pressing on 2:00:00 must show the remaining time left and so on...).
- Now place all the rest of the icons below the progress bar in a way that is logical and makes sense.
- When we send a very long comment, after a certain point, the rest of the comment will be cut off when appearing on full screen. Instead of this, give a fixed width for each comment box. If the words we have exceed this width, increase the comment's length dynamically and add words below rather than beside. If the words we have are less than the width, the width should adjust to that number of words. Do the same in the chat section, too.
- Also, when a user sends multiple comments simultaneously in a short period, before showing the second one, the first one disappears. When showing it in full screen, this should never happen; every comment should come like a bubble, move its way to the top, and eventually fade out, without being affected by any other comment's arrival.
